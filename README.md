# Sports Complex Management System

This project is a basic PHP & MySQL (port 3307) management system for a sports complex.

## Structure
- `index.php`: Main entry point
- `/assets`: Static files (CSS, JS)
- `/includes`: DB connection, authentication
- `/admin`, `/user`, `/booking`, `/equipment`: Feature modules

## Setup
- Ensure MySQL is running on port 3307 and a database named `sports_complex` exists.
- Update DB credentials in `includes/db.php` as needed.

## Usage
Open `index.php` in your local server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP) to start.
